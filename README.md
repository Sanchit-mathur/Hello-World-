# Hello-World-
Hello world in different programming languages

## Aim
This repository should eventually contain the famous "Hello World" program in all the programming languages possible...

## Languages Covered
1. C Language
C is a procedural programming language. It was initially developed by Dennis Ritchie as a system programming language to write an operating system.Include low-level access to memory, a simple set of keywords, and a clean style, these features make C language suitable for system programmings like operating system or compiler development.

2. C++ Language
C++, high-level computer programming language. Developed by Bjarne Stroustrup of Bell Laboratories in the early 1980s, it is based on the traditional C language but with added object-oriented programming and other capabilities.

3. C# Language
C# is pronounced as “C-Sharp”. It is an object-oriented programming language provided by Microsoft that runs on .Net Framework. Anders Hejlsberg is known as the founder of C# language. It is based on C++ and Java, but it has many additional extensions used to perform component-oriented programming approach. C# has evolved much since their first release in the year 2002. It was introduced with .NET Framework 1.0 and the current version of C# is 5.0. 

4. Python Language
Python is a widely-used, interpreted, object-oriented, and high-level programming language with dynamic semantics, used for general-purpose programming. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and first released on February 20, 1991. 

5. Swift Language
Swift is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm, object-oriented, functional, imperative, and block structured language. It is the result of the latest research on programming languages and is built using a modern approach to safety, software design patterns by Apple Inc.. It is the brand new programming language for the iOS application, macOS applications, watchOS applications, tvOS applications.

6. Java Language
Java was created at Sun Microsystems, Inc., where James Gosling led a team of researchers in an effort to create a new language that would allow consumer electronic devices to communicate with each other. Work on the language began in 1991, and before long the team’s focus changed to a new niche, the World Wide Web. Java was first released in 1995, and Java’s ability to provide interactivity and multimedia showed that it was particularly well suited for the Web.

7. JavaScript Language
JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language. It is designed for creating network-centric applications. It is complimentary to and integrated with Java. JavaScript is very easy to implement because it is integrated with HTML. It is open and cross-platform.

8. HTML Language
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, which is the most widely used language on Web to develop web pages. HTML was created by Berners-Lee in late 1991 but “HTML 2.0” was the first standard HTML specification which was published in 1995. HTML 4.01 was a major version of HTML, and it was published in late 1999.

9. TypeScript Language
TypeScript is a programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript and adds optional static typing to the language. TypeScript is designed for the development of large applications and transcompiles to JavaScript.

10. Ruby Language
Ruby is a pure object-oriented programming language. It was created in 1993 by Yukihiro Matsumoto of Japan. Ruby is open-source and is freely available on the Web, but it is subject to a license.
